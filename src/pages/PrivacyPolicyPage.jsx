      <p className="mb-6 italic">Effective Date: (23/07/2025)</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Oralens Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (“Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), the owner of
        the Arogyalens platform (including our website and mobile application,
        collectively the “Service”), is committed to protecting the privacy and rights
        of all users. This Privacy Policy outlines our policies regarding the
        collection, use, sharing, and protection of personal information of all users,
        including patients, doctors, hospitals, clinics, labs, pharmacies, and others,
        as well as important terms and liability disclaimers to protect our Company.
        By registering for or using Arogyalens, you agree to this Privacy Policy and

      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This Policy is published in compliance with applicable Indian laws, including
        the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology
        (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal
        Information) Rules, 2011 (“SPDI Rules”), and the Information Technology
        (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011. We follow all legal rules for data
        storage and privacy in India. Our goal is to cover all aspects of compliance
        while limiting our liability to the maximum extent permitted by law.

        1. Scope and Applicability
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        • Who This Policy Covers: This Privacy Policy applies to all users of Arogyalens, 
including but not limited to: 
• Patients (and their representatives) using the platform for teleconsultations, home 
consultations, booking hospital cabins, lab tests, blood bank services, pharmacy 
orders, and other healthcare services. 
• Healthcare Providers such as doctors, medical practitioners, clinics, hospitals, 
labs, pharmacies, or other entities who register on Arogyalens to offer services. 
• Other Users or visitors who access our website/app or use any part of our Service. 
• What This Policy Covers: This Policy covers how we collect, use, share, and 
protect your personal data when you use Arogyalens. It also includes important 
terms of use, disclaimers of warranties, and limitations of liability that apply to your 
use of our Service. The privacy practices and terms described here are applicable 
across all features of the platform (teleconsultation, home visits, hospital room 
rentals, lab tests, blood bank requests, pharmacy orders, feedback/reviews, etc.), 
and for all types of user accounts. 
• Consent to Terms: By creating an account or using any part of the Service, you 
confirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the legal adult age in your jurisdiction) 
and that you have read and consent to this Privacy Policy and Terms. If you are 
registering on behalf of someone else (e.g. a minor patient or as an authorized 
representative of a clinic/hospital), you represent that you have the authority to do 
so and to consent to this Policy on their behalf. Users are required to agree to this 
Policy (and our Terms & Conditions) as a condition before registration or use of 
Arogyalens. Continuing to use the Service after any updates to this Policy will signify 
your acceptance of those changes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        2. Information We Collect
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
       We collect various types of information from and about users to provide and improve our 
services. The types of data we collect depend on your relationship with the platform 
(patient, doctor, hospital, etc.) and the services you use. Below is an overview of 
information we may collect: </p>

<p className="mb-4">
• Personal Identification Information: When you register or fill your profile, we 
collect personal details such as your name, age, gender, contact number, email 
address, postal address, and identity verification details. For example: patients 
provide contact and demographic details; doctors provide professional information 
(qualification, registration number, license details, clinic address, etc.); 
hospitals/clinics provide facility details and registration documents. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Health and Medical Information: As a healthcare platform, we collect sensitive 
personal health data that you or your provider input on Arogyalens. This includes 
symptoms, medical history, current medications, allergies, diagnostic reports, 
prescriptions, treatment details, and any other health-related information you 
share. If you are a patient, the details you provide during teleconsultations or in 
health records (like your health issues, reports, past and current medical 
conditions) are collected. If you are a doctor or provider, we may collect information 
about your practice (specialty, treatment offered, consultation notes, etc.) and any 
content you input about patients (prescriptions, notes, etc.) in the course of 
providing services. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Service Usage Data: We collect data on how you use our platform. This includes 
appointment details (e.g. the date/time of bookings, doctors or services you book, 
appointment history), consultation records (e.g. chat logs, video call records or 
transcripts if applicable – which may be stored for record-keeping and legal 
compliance), feedback and reviews you provide, and any communications with us 
(customer support queries, emails, or phone calls). We may also log your 
interactions within the app or website (pages visited, features used, links clicked) to 
understand usage patterns. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Financial and Payment Information: If you make payments through Arogyalens for 
any service (consultation fees, lab tests, medicine orders, etc.), we will collect 
information related to the transaction. This may include your payment method 
details (such as cardholder name or UPI ID), billing address, and transaction 
records. Note: We do not store full payment instrument details like credit card 
numbers or UPI PINs on our servers. Payments are processed via secure, PCI
compliant third-party payment gateways. However, we maintain records of your 
transactions (amount, date, order details) for accounting and to facilitate refunds (if 
applicable). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Location Data: For certain services, we may request or derive your location 
information. For example, if you seek a home consultation, ambulance service, lab 
sample pickup, or pharmacy delivery, we might collect your precise address and/or 
use GPS location data to connect you with nearby providers. You will typically have 
to grant the mobile app permission to access location data for such features. 
Location data helps us show relevant services (like nearest hospital or blood bank) 
and facilitate providers reaching you. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Device and Technical Information: We automatically collect certain technical 
information when you use Arogyalens. This includes your device type (e.g. phone, 
tablet, computer), unique device identifiers, operating system and version, mobile 
network, IP address, browser type (for web access), and app version. We also 
collect log information such as the dates/times of access, duration of use, crashes 
or error reports, and other diagnostic data. This technical data helps us secure the 
Service, fix bugs, and optimize performance for better user experience. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Cookies and Tracking Technologies: Our website uses cookies and similar 
technologies to enhance user experience. Cookies are small files stored on your 
browser or device. We use cookies to maintain user sessions (for example, keeping 
you logged in), remember preferences, and gather web analytics. We may use third
party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) that set their own cookies to track how 
users navigate our site, so we can improve the design and content. You can control 
cookie settings through your browser, but disabling cookies might affect certain 
functionalities (such as remaining logged in or remembering preferences). Our 
mobile app may use analogous tracking technologies (like device identifiers) for 
similar purposes. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Information from Third Parties: In some cases, we might receive your data from 
third-party sources. For example, if you choose to sign in or integrate via a third
party service (such as using Google or social media for login), we will receive the 
basic profile information you authorize that service to share with us. Similarly, if a 
hospital or employer sponsors your use of Arogyalens (such as corporate health 
plans), they might share limited information about you to facilitate your onboarding. 
We also may receive updated contact or demographic information from service 
providers to keep our records current. Any such third-party data is combined with 
your account information and treated with the same protection under this Policy. 
Note: We do not intentionally collect data from anyone under 18 years old without parental 
consent. Arogyalens is not meant for unsupervised use by minors. If you are under the age 
of 18, you should use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian. If we 
become aware of personal data collected from a minor without proper consent, we will 
delete it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        3. How We Use Your Information
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
       We use the collected information for purposes of providing our services, ensuring a safe 
and efficient experience, and protecting our legal interests. The uses of data include:
</p>
<p className="mb-4"> 
• To Provide Services and Functionality: We process personal and health 
information so that you can use the platform’s features. For example, we use your 
data to create and manage your user account, schedule appointments, enable 
teleconsultations or home consultations, and maintain health records. Patient 
information is presented to doctors (and vice versa) at the time of consultation or 
booking to facilitate effective care. If you rent a hospital cabin or book a lab test, we 
use your details to arrange those services with the respective providers. We also 
use information to fulfill pharmacy orders or blood bank requests – e.g. sharing 
necessary details with the pharmacy delivering your medication or informing a 
blood bank of your request. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• For Communication: We use your contact information (email, phone number) to 
communicate with you about your use of Arogyalens. This includes sending 
appointment confirmations, reminders, updates, and any alerts regarding our 
services. For instance, you might receive SMS/WhatsApp messages for OTP 
verification or reminders for an upcoming consultation. We may also send service
related announcements (like changes in terms, security alerts, or support 
messages if you reach out with an issue). By using our services, you consent to 
receive such communications from us or our authorized partners, even if your 
number is on a Do-Not-Disturb registry. (We will not spam you, but we want to 
ensure you get important notifications about your care and our platform.) 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• To Facilitate Payments and Transactions: We use financial information to process 
payments for paid services. For example, when you pay consultation fees or buy a 
service package, we transmit your payment details to our payment gateway partner 
for processing and use the data to track and confirm your payment. If any refunds or 
billing issues arise (which are rare, as generally all sales are final), we use 
transaction records to address them. We also use data to prevent or detect fraud 
related to payments. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• To Personalize and Improve the Service: We may analyze your usage patterns, 
preferences, and feedback to improve Arogyalens for you and all users. This 
includes using data to personalize content – for example, suggesting relevant 
doctors or services based on your past usage, or customizing the user interface to 
your needs. We also use data in aggregate to identify trends, debug issues, and 
enhance features. For instance, we might analyze frequently accessed features to 
streamline our app’s navigation, or review feedback to improve our offerings. Health 
data and usage data (de-identified and aggregated) might be used to generate 
insights on how to better coordinate care or what new services to introduce. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• For Verification and Safety: We use provided documents and information from 
doctors, clinics, and other providers to verify their identity, qualifications, and 
eligibility to use the platform. This verification process helps maintain a high 
standard of trust and safety on Arogyalens. However, while we take reasonable 
steps to verify professional credentials of healthcare providers, we cannot 
guarantee that every detail is 100% accurate or up-to-date. Users are advised to 
use their own discretion as well (more on this in the Disclaimers section). We also 
use your information to enforce our terms and policies – for example, monitoring for 
fraudulent accounts, investigating suspicious activities, or restricting access in 
case of misuse. If required, we use data to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) 
or legal requirements (such as confirming a doctor’s registration number against 
government databases). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Being a healthcare-related service, we may be 
subject to certain regulations. We use and retain data as needed to comply with 
laws – for example, maintaining records of consultations as required by 
telemedicine guidelines or law, or producing information if ordered by a court or 
regulatory authority. We also honor rights and obligations under data protection 
laws: for instance, if you withdraw consent for certain data usage, we will cease 
that processing (except where required by law to retain data). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• For Feedback and Reviews: If you provide feedback or rate doctors/services on our 
platform, we may use that information to publish reviews (after moderation if 
needed) and to inform providers about their service quality. Your review may be 
visible to other users to help them make informed decisions. We may also reach out 
to you for feedback through in-app prompts, emails, or calls to gather insights on 
your experience with Arogyalens or with particular healthcare services. Providing 
feedback is optional, but if you do, you consent to our use of it as described 
(including possibly displaying it publicly along with your first name/initials). We 
reserve the right to moderate or remove reviews that violate our content guidelines 
or policies. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Marketing and Promotions: Currently, we do not sell or share your personal data 
for third-party marketing. We may, however, use your contact information to inform 
you about new features, services, or promotions offered by Arogyalens that could 
benefit you. Such communications will typically be part of the service updates. If we 
ever introduce separate marketing messages, we will provide you an option to opt
out of non-essential communications. Rest assured, any such usage of data will 
still comply with applicable law and this Policy. 
We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose that is not covered by 
this Privacy Policy or not obvious in the context of providing our services. By using 
Arogyalens, you agree that we can use your information for the purposes set out above.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        4. Disclosure of Information
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We treat your personal data with care and do not share it with outsiders except in the ways 
described below. We do not sell your personal information to any third-party for their own 
marketing. However, in order to operate the platform and deliver services, certain sharing 
is necessary: </p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Sharing with Healthcare Providers (Doctors, Hospitals, Labs, etc.): If you are a 
patient using our services, your relevant personal and health information will be 
shared with the healthcare providers involved in your care. For example, when you 
book a teleconsultation, we share your profile and medical details with the doctor 
so they can consult you effectively. If you schedule a home visit, the doctor (or 
medical professional visiting) will receive your address and contact info. When you 
book a lab test, we give the partner lab your details necessary for sample collection 
and report generation. Similarly, pharmacy orders will transmit your prescription 
and delivery info to the pharmacy fulfilling the order. We share only what is 
necessary for the provider to serve you. Providers are independently responsible 
for protecting your data once it is in their possession, and they should use it only for 
your treatment or as otherwise authorized by you. However, note that any data you 
provide directly to a provider (outside our platform) is not governed by this Policy. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Sharing with Patients and Other Users: If you are a healthcare provider on 
Arogyalens (doctor, clinic, hospital, lab, etc.), certain information about you will be 
visible to other users (especially patients). This includes information you provide in 
your public profile such as name, photo, qualifications, specialties, experience, 
consultation fees, clinic/hospital name and location, availability schedule, and 
patient reviews/ratings. This information is made available to help patients choose 
healthcare services. By registering as a provider, you consent to such information 
being publicly displayed. We may also share a provider’s contact details with a 
patient who has booked their services, to facilitate direct communication if needed 
(for instance, a patient may receive a doctor’s clinic address or phone for a home 
visit coordination). We limit what is shared to what is reasonably required for the 
service.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Service Providers and Partners: We rely on trusted third-party companies to 
perform certain functions on our behalf, and we need to share some data with them 
to get these done. These include:
</p>
<p className="mb-4"> 
• Hosting and Cloud Storage: Arogyalens is hosted on secure cloud servers (for 
example, we utilize Amazon Web Services in India for data storage and processing). 
Thus, your data resides on servers managed by such cloud provider, but under our 
control. We ensure such providers implement strong security measures.
</p>
<p className="mb-4"> 
• Communication Channels: We integrate APIs and services for sending 
communications – e.g. SMS gateways, WhatsApp Business API for messaging, or 
email service providers. If we send you an SMS or WhatsApp notification, your 
phone number and message content passes through these third-party systems. We 
share the minimum necessary info (like phone number and message text) for the 
service to work. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Payment Processors: When you make payments, we share data with payment 
gateway partners (like credit card processors, banks, UPI services). This can 
include your order amount, contact info, and order reference. These partners 
process your payment on our behalf. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Analytics and Support Tools: We may use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google 
Analytics, crash reporting services) that process usage data or error logs. We may 
also use customer support tools that manage emails or chat communications you 
send us. These providers might incidentally process some personal data while 
providing their services (for example, an analytics tool might record your user ID or 
device info when logging an app crash). 
We ensure that all such third-party service providers are bound by appropriate contracts to 
protect your data and use it only for the specified purposes. They cannot use your data for 
any other purposes not authorized by us. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Business Transfers: If our company undergoes a business transaction such as a 
merger, acquisition, reorganization, or asset sale, user information (including 
personal data) might be among the assets transferred to the new entity. If such a 
transfer occurs, we will ensure that your data remains subject to a privacy policy 
that offers at least the same level of protection as this one. We will notify users (for 
example, via a notice on our website or email) if their personal data is to be 
transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy as a result. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Legal Compliance and Protection: We may disclose personal information to 
courts, law enforcement or regulatory authorities, or other government agencies if 
required by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Comply with a legal obligation, government request or judicial order (for instance, 
responding to a court subpoena or lawful investigation). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Enforce our Terms and policies, or investigate potential violations (e.g., suspected 
fraud, misuse of our platform, or security incidents). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Protect the rights, property, or safety of Oralens Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., our users, or 
the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and 
organizations for the purposes of fraud detection and credit risk reduction, and 
sharing data in emergency situations where someone’s life or health is at risk. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• With Your Consent: Apart from the scenarios above, we will inform you and obtain 
your consent before sharing your personal data with any third party for purposes not 
covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, if in the future there is a feature to share 
your data with an insurance provider or a research institution, you would have the 
ability to opt-in to such sharing. You are in control of whether we share your 
information in any new or non-standard scenarios. 
We emphasize that user privacy is paramount to us. Any third parties with whom we 
share data as per the above are obligated to handle it with strict confidentiality and 
security. We also do not allow any third party to sell or misuse your personal 
information. If you have questions about third parties who may have access to your data, 
contact us for more information. 

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        5. Data Storage and Security
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
      We understand the sensitive nature of health and personal data, and we take appropriate 
security measures to safeguard your information against unauthorized access or 
disclosure. Here’s how we protect and manage your data: 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Data Location: All personal data collected through Arogyalens is stored on secure 
servers located in India. We abide by data localization requirements as applicable. 
By keeping data within India, we comply with local regulations and aim to reduce 
latency for Indian users. Our primary servers are hosted with reputable cloud 
providers (such as AWS India) in state-of-the-art data centers with 24/7 security and 
monitoring. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Encryption: We employ strong encryption protocols to protect data. All data 
transmission between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry
standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS). This means that sensitive information (like login 
credentials, health details, or payment information) is encrypted in transit so that it 
cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties. We also encrypt sensitive data at 
rest in our databases whenever feasible, especially for health records and personal 
identifiers. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Access Controls: We limit access to personal data strictly to authorized personnel 
and service providers who need it to operate and improve our Service. Within our 
company, only those with a valid business need (for example, a support agent 
helping you resolve an issue, or an engineer maintaining the system) can access 
personal data, and even then, only the minimum necessary. All our employees and 
contractors are bound by confidentiality obligations. Additionally, the system is 
designed so that each user’s data is isolated – you must be authenticated to access 
your own data, and providers only see patient data of users who have engaged with 
them (or as required for care). Providers (doctors, etc.) using our platform are also 
expected to maintain confidentiality of any patient data they receive, in line with 
their professional ethics and legal obligations. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Security Practices: We follow industry best practices and reasonable security 
standards to protect data. Our security measures include regular software updates 
and periodic security audits of our infrastructure. We also implement reasonable 
security practices and procedures as required under the SPDI Rules for protecting 
sensitive personal information. We have an internal incident response plan for any 
security breaches and will take immediate action should an issue be identified. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Third-Party Security: When we work with third-party service providers (as 
described in the previous section), we choose reputable partners with strong 
security track records. We ensure via contracts that they maintain strict security 
and confidentiality measures. For example, our payment gateways are PCI-DSS 
compliant (a security standard for payment data). Our communications providers 
also use encryption and secure channels. We periodically review our third-party 
integrations to ensure ongoing protection of your information. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• No Guarantee Clause: While we are committed to protecting your data, it’s 
important to note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic 
storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data. Users play 
a role in security too. Protect your login credentials: You are responsible for 
maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for all activities under 
your account. Do not share your password with anyone. If you suspect any 
unauthorized access or account misuse, please notify us immediately. We will not 
be liable for any loss or compromise of your data due to your failure to safeguard 
your account information or due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control 
(such as sophisticated hacking by third parties, provided we have followed required 
security practices). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Data Breach Procedures: In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your 
personal information, we will promptly inform the affected users and take all 
necessary steps to mitigate the impact. We may also inform law enforcement or 
data protection authorities as required by law. Our priority will be to minimize any 
harm and prevent further unauthorized access. 
By using Arogyalens, you acknowledge that you understand the inherent security risks in 
online services and agree that we have implemented reasonable measures to protect your 
data. You use the Service at your own risk. We will continually update and refine our 
security practices as technology evolves to stay ahead of threats. 
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        6. Data Retention and Deletion
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
       We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it 
was collected, or as required or permitted by law. Different types of data may have 
different retention periods based on the context of its collection and use: 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Account Information: For general users (patients and providers), we retain your 
profile information and account data as long as your account remains active. You 
have the option to delete your account – if you choose to do so (or request us to do 
so), we will initiate the process of deleting or anonymizing your personal 
information. However, certain residual data may persist in backups or logs for a 
short period, and we may retain some information if required for legal obligations 
(explained more below). 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Health and Consultation Records: Medical records and consultation histories 
may be retained for a minimum period as mandated by law or medical guidelines. 
Even if you delete your account or discontinue use, we might need to retain certain 
health consultation records for a prescribed time (for example, Telemedicine 
Practice Guidelines or other healthcare regulations might require retention of 
prescriptions or consultation logs for a few years). We will securely store such data 
and restrict access to it, and it will be deleted once it is no longer required. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Transaction and Financial Records: Payment and transaction records are retained 
as long as needed for accounting, auditing, and compliance with tax or financial 
regulations. Typically, financial records are kept for at least the duration required by 
tax laws (which can be up to 8 years or more in some jurisdictions). These records 
will include minimal personal info (like your name, transaction amount, date) as 
needed to document the transaction. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Communications and Support: If you have communicated with us via support 
email or chat, those communications may be stored for a period for quality 
assurance and to help in future inquiries. We typically retain support 
communications for a reasonable time, after which they are deleted or anonymized 
unless needed for ongoing issues. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Backups: Our system performs routine backups to prevent data loss. Backup 
copies of databases might contain your information even after it is deleted from the 
live system. However, all backups are stored securely and are only accessible to 
authorized personnel for disaster recovery purposes. Backup data is rotated and 
overwritten periodically, so any deleted data will be purged from backups in due 
course as those backups cycle out. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Deletion Requests: You may request deletion of your personal data by contacting 
us (see Contact section). Upon such request, and subject to verification of your 
identity, we will delete or anonymize your personal data that we are not legally 
required or permitted to retain. Note that after deleting your account, you will not 
be able to use our services unless you create a new account. Also, even after 
deletion, certain data that does not identify you personally may be retained (for 
example, aggregated statistics or de-identified information). We also reserve the 
right to retain information to the extent we believe it’s necessary to prevent fraud or 
future abuse, or to exercise or defend our rights. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Legal Holds: If we are under a legal obligation to retain data (such as a court order 
to preserve information, or data relevant to an ongoing dispute or investigation), we 
will retain the data for as long as instructed. During such a period, we cannot delete 
the data even if requested by a user, until the legal hold is lifted. 
In summary, we strive not to keep personal data longer than needed. When data is no 
longer required, we ensure it is securely deleted or irreversibly anonymized. If you have 
specific questions about how long certain data is kept, feel free to reach out to us. 
      </p>

       We want you to be in control of your personal information. Subject to applicable law, you 
have the following rights and choices regarding your data on Arogyalens:</p>
<p className="mb-4"> 
• Access and Correction: You can access and update most of your personal profile 
information directly through the app/website by logging into your account. This 
includes editing your contact details, password, or (for providers) updating your 
profile and practice information. It’s your responsibility to ensure that the 
information you provide is accurate and up-to-date. If you find any inaccuracies in 
the information that you cannot correct yourself, you have the right to request 
correction. Contact us with details of the incorrect information, and we will rectify it 
as appropriate. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Consent and Withdrawal: By providing sensitive personal information (like health 
data), you consent to our processing of it for the purposes outlined. We rely on this 
consent to offer the services. You have the right to withdraw your consent to our 
collection and use of your personal data at any time, however please note that 
withdrawal of consent will likely require us to deactivate or delete your account, as 
we cannot provide our services without necessary data. For example, if you 
withdraw consent for us to use your health information, we will not be able to 
connect you with doctors or maintain your health records, effectively disabling your 
use of Arogyalens. We will inform you of the consequences if you choose to 
withdraw consent. Where possible, we may allow you to opt-out of specific uses of 
data (like receiving promotional emails) without having to delete your entire 
account. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Data Portability: Under certain regulations (like GDPR, if applicable to a user), you 
may have the right to request a copy of personal data you have provided to us in a 
machine-readable format, and/or to request that we transmit it to another service 
provider if technically feasible. While our primary user base is in India, if you are 
entitled to this right and request it, we will provide the data export to the extent 
required by law. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Right to Erasure: You may request that we erase your personal data. As explained 
in the Data Retention section, we will comply with such requests to the extent we 
can, consistent with law and legitimate interest. We will delete or anonymize the 
data that we are not required to keep. Keep in mind, due to backups and legal 
requirements, complete immediate erasure may not be possible, but we will act on 
the request promptly and inform you once completed. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Managing Communications: You can control certain communications from us. For 
instance, you may unsubscribe from marketing or newsletter emails (if any) via the 
unsubscribe link in those emails. However, you cannot opt-out of essential 
service communications (such as appointment confirmations, important updates 
about your account, or security notifications) as those are integral to using the 
platform. For notifications like SMS/WhatsApp alerts, you can contact support if 
you wish to adjust how you receive those (e.g., opt-out of WhatsApp notifications 
and receive only SMS or vice versa, where feasible). We will honor reasonable 
communication preferences. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Cookies Choices: For website users, you can manage cookies through your 
browser settings. You can delete or block cookies, but some parts of our site might 
not function properly thereafter (e.g., you may have to log in again each time as 
session cookies are disabled). We currently do not support Do Not Track (DNT) 
signals – if you enable DNT on your browser, our site may not recognize it, but we 
only use cookies as described in this Policy. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Grievance Redressal: If you have any grievances or concerns regarding your 
personal data or this Privacy Policy, you have the right to complain or ask for 
resolution. We have designated a Grievance Officer (see Contact section below) as 
per the IT Act requirements. We will acknowledge and address any complaints 
within the timeline prescribed by law. We are committed to resolving issues fairly 
and transparently. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We also inform you 
that, per Indian SPDI Rules, you have the option not to provide certain information or to 
withdraw consent, but if the information is mandatory for us to provide a service, we 
reserve the right to not provide that service in absence of the data. For example, a phone 
number is needed for account creation (for OTP verification and communication); if you 
choose not to provide a phone number, we cannot register you. 
If you require assistance in exercising any of these rights, please contact us using the 
details in the Contact section. We may need to verify your identity (to prevent unauthorized 
access to data) before acting on a request.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        8. Third-Party Links and Services
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
       Arogyalens may contain links to third-party websites or integrate third-party services that 
are not operated by us. For example, our app may have links to health content articles on 
external websites, or our website might feature links to partner healthcare providers’ 
pages, or we may facilitate connecting to a third-party pharmacy or diagnostic service 
within our platform. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by those 
third-party websites or services. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Third-Party Websites: If you click on a link to an external site (for instance, an 
article about a health topic or a partner’s website), you will be directed outside our 
platform. We do not control and are not responsible for the content, privacy 
practices, or policies of these external sites. We encourage you to review the 
privacy policies of any third-party site you visit before providing any personal 
information. The inclusion of a link on our platform does not imply our endorsement 
of the third-party’s practices or content. You use such links at your own risk, and 
we will not be liable for any issues arising from your use of third-party websites.
</p>
<p className="mb-4"> 
• Third-Party Services within Arogyalens: Some services accessible via Arogyalens 
may be provided by third parties under partnership or integration. For example, 
certain lab test bookings might actually be fulfilled by a partner provider who has its 
own systems, or a pharmacy order might redirect through a partner’s portal. We 
strive to ensure any such integration upholds our standards, but any information 
you directly provide to a third-party service (even if initiated via our app) will be 
governed by that party’s terms and privacy policy. We will let you know within the 
flow of the app if a particular service is delivered by a third party so you can make an 
informed choice. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Social Media Plugins: Our services might include social media features or plugins 
(e.g., a Facebook “Like” button on a blog page, or an option to share something via 
Twitter). These features may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting, 
and may set a cookie to function properly. Social media features are either hosted 
by a third party or directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are 
governed by the privacy policy of the respective social media company. 
In summary, once you leave our platform or engage with a third-party integration, our 
responsibility for your data ceases for that interaction. Nonetheless, we seek to work 
only with trusted partners and aim to minimize sharing of personal data to third parties 
without your knowledge. Please exercise caution and read privacy policies when dealing 
with external sites or services. 
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        9. Platform Usage Terms and Responsibilities
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
       In addition to privacy practices, when using Arogyalens, all users must adhere to certain 
terms of use designed to protect everyone’s interests (especially ours, as the platform 
provider). Below are key user responsibilities and acknowledgments: 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Account Security: Users must provide accurate and truthful information during 
registration and keep their account credentials secure. You are responsible for all 
activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of 
your account or a security breach, you must notify us immediately. We are not liable 
for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of 
your password or account. We may suspend or terminate access if we believe an 
account is compromised or being misused. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Accuracy of Information: We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or 
quality of information posted by users (including doctors, patients, or others) on the 
platform. This includes profile information, medical advice given, or content in 
reviews. While we take steps to verify and moderate content (for instance, verifying 
doctor credentials and moderating reviews for appropriate content), we rely on 
users to provide truthful information. We shall not be responsible for the 
authenticity of personal or sensitive information supplied by users. Users 
should exercise due caution and verify information independently where needed. If 
you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or outdated, or if we suspect 
such, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at our sole 
discretion. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Prohibited Uses: You agree not to misuse Arogyalens. This means you will not: (a) 
engage in any unlawful or fraudulent activities; (b) harass or harm other users (for 
example, no abusive language or inappropriate content during consultations or in 
reviews); (c) attempt to hack, overload, or impair the platform’s normal functioning; 
(d) scrape or extract data or content without authorization; (e) use the Service for 
any purpose other than seeking/providing legitimate healthcare services. If we 
detect any such misuse, we may take action including content removal, account 
suspension, and legal proceedings if necessary. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• User-Generated Content (Reviews & Feedback): If you post reviews, ratings, or 
other content on Arogyalens, you must do so in accordance with our content 
guidelines. You must not post any defamatory, offensive, obscene, or illegal 
content, or any content that infringes others’ rights (including privacy and 
intellectual property rights). We act only as an intermediary in publishing user 
reviews and do not endorse them. We reserve the right (but not obligation) to 
moderate or remove reviews that violate our terms or applicable laws. We are not 
liable for any content posted by users, and users are solely responsible for the 
content they publish. If you believe another user’s content is violating your rights or 
our policies, please report it to us for review. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• No Emergency Services: Arogyalens is NOT for medical emergencies. If you have 
a serious or life-threatening condition, or any medical emergency, you should 
immediately call emergency services or visit a hospital in person. Our platform is 
not equipped to handle real-time emergency scenarios. You acknowledge that you 
will not use Arogyalens as a substitute for ambulance or emergency care. We have 
made this clear, and thus we hold no liability for outcomes if the platform is 
inappropriately used in urgent situations. 
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• Applicable Medical Guidelines: Our platform facilitates telemedicine and other 
healthcare services in line with prevailing laws and guidelines. Users (especially 
medical practitioners) are expected to adhere to the Telemedicine Practice 
Guidelines and any other regulations applicable to them. For instance, doctors 
should follow proper protocol for online prescribing (no prescribing prohibited 
medications, etc.), and patients should provide honest and full information to 
enable proper advice. The Company is not responsible for any user’s failure to 
follow legal or professional obligations. 
By using our Service, you agree to these usage terms. Violating these terms may result in 
suspension of service and potential legal consequences. We aim to ensure that 
Arogyalens remains a safe, reliable platform for all users, and your cooperation is essential 
in achieving that. 

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        10. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
       To the maximum extent permitted by law, Oralens Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. disclaims all warranties and liabilities regarding your use of Arogyalens. By using the platform, you expressly understand and agree to the following disclaimers:
       </p>
       <p className="mb-4">
• Intermediary Platform; No Medical Advice by Company: Arogyalens is an intermediary technology platform that connects users (patients) with independent third-party healthcare providers (doctors, clinics, etc.). The Company is not a healthcare provider and does not practice medicine or any profession. Any medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations you receive come directly from the independent registered medical practitioners, not from the Arogyalens platform or Company. We do not make medical decisions for you; we only facilitate your interaction with those who do. The information or content available on our platform (including any health tips or answers to queries) is for general informational purposes and does not constitute medical advice from us. No doctor-patient relationship is created between you and the Company by using the platform; the doctor-patient relationship exists only between you and the chosen medical practitioner.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
• No Endorsement or Guarantee of Providers: We do not recommend or endorse any specific doctor, hospital, laboratory, or other healthcare provider listed on Arogyalens. The inclusion of any practitioner or facility in our listings does not mean we guarantee their quality, qualifications, or suitability. Although we verify basic credentials (registration, etc.) and strive to display accurate information, we make no warranties or representations about any healthcare provider’s expertise, quality of work, or the information they provide. Your choice to engage with a particular doctor or service is at your own risk and discretion. We strongly advise you to perform your own due diligence (for example, checking a doctor’s credentials or seeking second opinions where appropriate) before using their services. Any ratings or reviews by other users are subjective and not endorsed by us.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
          •
Service “As Is” and No Warranty*: Arogyalens and all services are provided on an “*as is” and “as available” basis without any warranties, express or implied . We do not guarantee that the platform will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free from viruses or other harmful components. We disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement . For example, we do not warrant that using Arogyalens will result in any specific health outcome or that the advice given by a provider will meet your expectations. While we strive for excellence, use of the platform is at your own risk and you assume full responsibility for any risk of loss or damage arising from it.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
•
Limited Liability for Healthcare Outcomes: The Company shall not be liable for any medical negligence, misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment, or lack of suitability of any advice or service provided by the healthcare professionals on our platform . Any interactions or dealings between you and a healthcare provider (including sharing of information, provision of medical services, and payments) are strictly between you and that provider . We are not responsible for any outcome of such interactions – whether it’s an unsatisfactory consultation, side effects from a prescribed medication, or any health complications arising thereafter . In the event of any dispute or claim regarding medical services (like malpractice or professional misconduct by a doctor), you agree that the claim shall be pursued solely against the responsible provider, and not against the Company, since we play no role in the provision of medical care .
</p>
<p className="mb-4">


•
No Liability for User Conduct or Content: We are not liable for the behavior of any user on the platform, whether it be a patient or provider. This includes any offensive or inappropriate conduct by users, or any content (such as messages or reviews) posted by users. While we may moderate content and have usage rules, the users themselves are accountable for their actions and content. If you have a negative experience with another user (for example, a doctor’s behavior or a patient’s misuse), we regret that, but the Company is not responsible for the actions of third parties on the platform . We may, at our discretion, facilitate resolving certain issues or complaints between users, but this does not in any way make us liable for those issues.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
•
Transactions and Payments: Any payments you make for services through Arogyalens (such as consultation fees, lab test fees, medicine orders, or hospital booking fees) are non-refundable by default. All sales are final, and we offer no returns or refunds on services availed, except in cases where we decide (at our sole discretion) that a refund is justified or where required by applicable law. For instance, if a service you paid for is not delivered at all due to a fault on our or the provider’s part, we may consider a refund or re-service on a case-by-case basis. However, if you simply are unhappy with a completed consultation or change your mind after a service is rendered, you will not be entitled to a refund. If we collect payments on behalf of a provider (e.g., we facilitate your payment of a doctor’s fee),
any decision on refunds of that fee will typically lie with the provider and their policy , and we disclaim responsibility for such financial disputes. We encourage users to carefully review service details before making payments . In short, no refund or return shall be provided by the Company for services/products once availed, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
•
Limitation of Damages: To the fullest extent allowed by law, the Company (and its directors, officers, employees, and affiliates) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) Arogyalens, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, without limitation, any damages for lost profits, lost data, personal injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, or similar harm, or costs of procuring substitute services. In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitations of liability, our liability will be limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
•
Cap on Liability: In the event that liability is established against the Company notwithstanding the above disclaimers, our aggregate liability to you for any and all claims arising from use of the Service shall not exceed the amount (if any) you paid to us for the use of the Service in the 6 months preceding the claim. If you have not paid any amount (for example, if you only used free features), the Company’s total liability shall be zero to the extent permissible by law. This limitation applies to all causes of action, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
•
Indemnification: You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Oralens Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your use or misuse of Arogyalens; (b) your violation of any term of this Policy or our Terms of Use; (c) your violation of any rights of a third party (including other users or any intellectual property or privacy right); or (d) any negligent or intentional wrongdoing by you . This obligation will survive any termination of your relationship with Arogyalens or cessation of use of our services. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
•
Company as “Intermediary” Safe Harbor: Under Indian law (specifically, the IT Act and Intermediary Guidelines), Arogyalens is categorized as an “intermediary” that merely facilitates communication between users. We do not initiate or select the receiver of any transmission, nor do we modify any information in the transmission. As such, we claim the safe-harbor exemptions from liability for any third-party information or content hosted on our platform, as long as we observe due diligence and applicable guidelines. We have internal policies to address unlawful content; if notified properly, we act expeditiously to remove or disable
access to any unlawful material as required by law. Users acknowledge this intermediary status and agree that the Company’s role is limited.
In plain terms, while we do our best to provide a valuable service, we do not assume liability for risks inherent in using our platform or for the actions of users and providers. You use Arogyalens understanding that we have put these protections in place for our company. If you do not agree with these disclaimers and liability limitations, please refrain from using the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        11. Changes to this Privacy Policy
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may update or modify this Privacy Policy (and the incorporated Terms and disclaimers) from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When we make changes, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of the Policy. If changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice of the update, such as via an email notification to registered users or a pop-up notice in the app.
Your continued use of Arogyalens after the updated Policy becomes effective will be deemed acceptance of the changes. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information and what terms apply to your use. If you do not agree to the updated terms, you should stop using the Service and may request deletion of your data as described above.
Remember, this Policy is a living document – as our platform evolves and as laws change, we will adjust our privacy and terms accordingly, always with an aim to maintain robust protection for us and transparency to you.
